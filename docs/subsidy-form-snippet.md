### x402Solana x402 NPM SDK

We have developed a dedicated x402Solana x402 NPM SDK (`@fozagtx/x402-sdk`) to simplify integration of AI-powered, agent-to-agent Solana payments.

- Provides helpers to construct x402 payment requests, build Solana transactions, and submit them with sensible defaults.
- Easy to install via `npm install @fozagtx/x402-sdk @solana/web3.js`.
- Fully typed with TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript, compatible with modern Node.js and browser bundlers.
- Integrates directly with Solana SPL/native SOL payments and the x402 protocol’s invoice/payment-request model.
