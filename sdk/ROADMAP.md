# @fozagtx/x402-sdk Strategic Roadmap

This document tracks the long-term roadmap for the x402Solana x402 SDK, broken into four execution phases and supporting release milestones.

## Phase 1 – Core SDK Enhancements (v0.3.x)

**Invoice lifecycle**
- Add `updateInvoice`, `cancelInvoice`, and `duplicateInvoice` methods to the SDK client.
- Support recurring invoices via metadata + helper builders (intervals, retry policies).
- Provide batch invoice creation (`createInvoicesBulk`) with typed responses and partial-failure handling.
- Introduce webhook registration helpers plus a typed WebSocket/EventSource client for invoice status updates.

**Payment tracking**
- Extend `payInvoice` to capture SPL token confirmations (USDC, USDT) and surface commitment levels.
- Add a listener API (`sdk.onPaymentReceipt(...)`) that emits transaction receipts for agents/merchants.
- Support multi-wallet/multi-signature flows by allowing callers to pass arrays of signer adapters and threshold policies.

**Wallet integration**
- Design a `WalletAdapter` interface compatible with Phantom, Solflare, Slope, Ledger, and cold wallets.
- Auto-detect available wallets in browser and Node runtimes, falling back to Keypair when none are found.
- Document offline signing flows (export transaction → sign offline → submit).

**Error handling & logging**
- Introduce a shared `X402Error` with machine-readable `code`, `details`, and human-readable `message`.
- Provide retry/backoff utilities for transient RPC and network failures.
- Add optional hooks (`onLog`, `onError`) for piping structured logs to user observability stacks.

## Phase 2 – Autonomous Agent & Bot Workflows (v0.4.x)

**Agent payment flows**
- Helpers for agent-to-agent payment requests (including negotiation metadata).
- Conditional payments triggered by events (data thresholds, subscription cycles) configured via policy objects.
- Scheduling utilities that coordinate delayed/recurring payments with automated retries.

**Messaging bots**
- Ship Telegram/Discord modules (likely under `sdk/bots/`) for in-chat invoice creation and confirmation embeds.
- Provide agent dashboards inside chat apps, surfacing outstanding invoices and payment proofs.
- Include reference bots in `examples/telegram-bot` and `examples/discord-bot`.

**AI workflows**
- Recipes for digital-goods marketplaces: create invoice → wait for fulfillment signal → auto-payout.
- Helpers for autonomous tipping/rewards triggered by AI interactions (chat completions, actions).
- Integration examples showing how to plug into AI marketplaces or tool frameworks.

## Phase 3 – Advanced Protocol & Security Features (v0.5.x)

**x402 protocol upgrades**
- Signed/hashed invoices with cryptographic verification and version negotiation.
- Multi-token routing (USDC, USDT, custom SPL tokens) including token metadata discovery.
- On-chain dispute/refund primitives and helper flows for escrow-like experiences.

**Security & compliance**
- Enforce non-custodial wallet design with best-practice guidance.
- Anti-replay and double-spend protection (nonce tracking, memo enforcement).
- Configurable invoice expiry policies and append-only audit log exports for regulators/investors.

**Cross-chain groundwork**
- Interfaces for multi-chain invoices (e.g., Solana invoice that settles via Ethereum or Aptos bridge).
- Experimental bridge-aware settlement modules to evaluate feasibility and constraints.

## Phase 4 – Developer & Integration Tooling (v0.6.x → v1.0)

**DX improvements**
- Maintain strict TypeScript definitions, publish both ESM and CJS bundles, and ensure Node/Browser parity.
- Continue seamless npm install experience under `@fozagtx/x402-sdk`.

**CLI utilities**
- Build a `x402` CLI (`npx x402`) supporting invoice creation, status monitoring, and batch transactions.
- Share configuration (API keys, RPC URLs) between the CLI and the TypeScript SDK via a common config file format.

**Analytics & observability**
- Optional middleware to emit metrics (payment success/failure, confirmation time distribution, agent activity).
- Provide dashboards/examples (e.g., Grafana/Looker Studio) demonstrating how to visualize the metrics stream.

**Example projects**
- Telegram bot integration showcasing agent approvals and receipts.
- Merchant web dashboard demo with real-time invoice tracking.
- AI agent simulation environment illustrating autonomous payments and retries.

## Execution Strategy

1. **Product requirements** – Gather detailed API contracts for recurring/batch invoices, WebSocket payloads, signer abstractions, and messaging bot requirements.
2. **Milestone planning** – Break Phase 1 into incremental releases (v0.3.0, v0.3.1, …) with clear changelogs and migration guides; repeat for later phases.
3. **Quality gates** – Expand automated tests (unit + devnet integration), add contract tests for webhook/WebSocket schemas, and run example projects in CI prior to each release.
4. **Community feedback** – Announce milestones (blog/Discord/Twitter), tag GitHub issues with `sdk`, and prioritize backlog based on merchant + agent developer feedback.
